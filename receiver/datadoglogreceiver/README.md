## Overview

The datadog log receiver enables translation between Datadog agent logs and OpenTelemetry-compatible backends.

## Configuration

Configuration wise is very simple, just need to specify where the Datadog receiver should listen and the read timeout.

Then, the receiver must be configured in the pipeline where it will be used.

```yaml
receivers:
    datadoglog:
        http:
          endpoint: ${env:MY_POD_IP}:10518
        version: v2_api
```

### version

Must be `v2_api`


### http
As documented [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/confighttp/README.md)

Configuring `endpoint` is a must.
