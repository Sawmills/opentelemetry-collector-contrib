  The new --span-links flag allows generating spans with links to previously created spans.
  Each span can link to random existing span contexts, creating relationships between spans for testing
  distributed tracing scenarios. Links include attributes for link type and index identification.
========
  When enabled, the exporter will automatically use the AWS PrivateLink endpoint for the configured domain.
  If the domain is already set to a PrivateLink one, no further change to the endpoint will be made.
